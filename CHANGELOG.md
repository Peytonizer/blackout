# Changelog

Notable changes to Blackout, newest first.

## Unreleased

- Project initiated: specification, build order and instructions written; repository
  scaffolded with its licence, ignore rules, README and changelog.
- Build-order stage 1: Vite + React + Tailwind + oxlint + vitest scaffold. CSP meta tag with
  `connect-src 'none'` and dark `color-scheme` in `index.html`; Signal theme tokens in
  `tailwind.config.js`, copied from the reconciled Scrubber config; self-hosted fonts; commit
  SHA stamped into the build via `vite.commit-sha.js`. Empty app shell with a header and
  footer, no document logic yet.
